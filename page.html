    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: "WeatherView"</h3>
    <p>

My first programming project, which I worked on for a week during the 2020 Programming
bootcamp, was an application deisgned to gather a small amount of information about the
weather in your local area. It used a series of public access APIs - firstly getting your
external IP address, feeding that to a location API, and then feeding the location to a
weather API. The API response would subsequently be broken down into a series of variables,
which were used to create a 2D animation. Take a look at the video.
